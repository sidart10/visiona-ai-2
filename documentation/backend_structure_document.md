# Backend Structure Document

This document outlines the backend architecture, database management, API design, hosting solutions, infrastructure components, and security measures for Visiona, an AI-driven web platform for creating personalized AI clones. The goal is to provide a clear overview of the backend setup in everyday language, ensuring anyone can understand how everything works, while including sufficient technical detail for tools like Cursor to generate the correct code.

## 1. Backend Architecture

The Visiona backend is built on a modern, serverless approach using Next.js API Routes. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the architecture:

*   **Design Patterns and Frameworks**:
    *   Uses serverless functions provided by Next.js API Routes for handling requests.
    *   Relies on established frameworks and integrations (e.g., Clerk for authentication, Supabase for database and storage, Replicate for AI model training and image generation).
    *   Business logic is separated into clear endpoints to enforce modularity and easier maintenance.

*   **Key Responsibilities**:
    *   **User Authentication & Management**: Integration with Clerk manages secure signups, logins, and account management.
    *   **Photo Upload & AI Integration**: 
        *   Users upload images via the web app, which are temporarily stored in Supabase Storage.
        *   These images are zipped and sent to Replicate’s Flux LoRA training service to create a custom AI model.
        *   After training, the images are deleted from Supabase Storage to ensure user privacy.
    *   **Image Generation**: 
        *   Users provide a text prompt, which may be enhanced by GPT-4o or Claude for better results.
        *   The enhanced prompt is used with the user’s trained model on Replicate to generate a new image.
        *   The generated image is stored in Supabase Storage and linked to the user’s account.
    *   **Payment Processing**: Manages subscription tiers and payments via Stripe.
    *   **Gallery Management**: Retrieves, sorts, and secures the display of generated images.

*   **Scalability and Maintainability**:
    *   The serverless nature ensures automatic scaling with traffic fluctuations.
    *   Separation of concerns (authentication, image generation, payment, gallery management) ensures updates in one component don’t disrupt others.
    *   Modern tools like Next.js, Supabase, and Replicate ensure performance as usage grows.

## 2. Database Management

Data management is a crucial part of Visiona. Here are the core details, updated to reflect Replicate integration:

*   **Database Technologies Used**:
    *   **SQL Database**: Supabase using PostgreSQL.
    *   **Storage**: Supabase Storage, managed with secure policies.

*   **Data Structure and Management Practices**:
    *   **Structured Data**: User accounts, image metadata, payment records, and Replicate-trained model details are stored in structured tables in PostgreSQL.
    *   **Access Control**: Supabase’s Row-Level Security (RLS) ensures users can only access their own data, including trained models and generated images.
    *   **Backups and Retention**: Regular, automated backups with a 30-day retention policy.
    *   **Encryption**: Sensitive data, such as API keys, user details, and Replicate model IDs, are encrypted to protect against unauthorized access.

## 3. Database Schema

Here’s the updated schema for Visiona’s PostgreSQL database via Supabase, with clarifications for Replicate integration:

```sql
-- Table: users
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    clerk_id VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL, -- Identifier from Clerk
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Table: photos
CREATE TABLE photos (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    file_url TEXT NOT NULL,
    uploaded_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Table: models
CREATE TABLE models (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    model_id TEXT NOT NULL, -- Unique identifier of the trained model from Replicate
    trigger_word VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'Processing', -- Statuses: Processing, Ready, Failed
    parameters JSONB NOT NULL, -- Stores training parameters for Replicate
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Table: generations
CREATE TABLE generations (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    model_id INT REFERENCES models(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
    prompt TEXT NOT NULL,
    enhanced_prompt TEXT,
    image_url TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Table: payments
CREATE TABLE payments (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    stripe_charge_id VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    amount NUMERIC(10,2) NOT NULL,
    currency VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
    status VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Table: audit_logs (for security and tracking events)
CREATE TABLE audit_logs (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
    action VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    details JSONB,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

**Notes**:
- The `model_id` field in the `models` table now explicitly stores the unique identifier returned by Replicate after training, used for subsequent image generation.
- The `parameters` field in JSONB format can store Replicate-specific training parameters (e.g., epochs, learning rate).

                    model: 'flux-lora',
                  });

                  // Store training job in Supabase
                  await storeTrainingJob(userId, training.id);

                  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Training started', trainingId: training.id });
                }
                ```
        *   `/api/models/status`:
            *   Checks the status of a training job by querying Replicate’s API with the training ID.
            *   Updates the `models` table and returns the status to the frontend.

    *   **Image Generation Endpoints**:
        *   `/api/generate`:
            *   Receives a request with the user’s Clerk ID, model ID, and text prompt.
            *   Optionally enhances the prompt using GPT-4o or Claude.
            *   Calls Replicate’s prediction API with the trained model and prompt.
            *   Stores the generated image in Supabase Storage and records it in the database.
            *   **Code Example**:
                ```javascript
                // /api/generate.js
                import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs';
                import Replicate from 'replicate';

                export default async function handler(req, res) {
                  const { userId } = auth();
                  const { modelId, prompt } = req.body;

                  // Optionally enhance prompt
                  const enhancedPrompt = await enhancePrompt(prompt);

                  // Initialize Replicate client
                  const replicate = new Replicate({ apiToken: process.env.REPLICATE_API_TOKEN });
                  const prediction = await replicate.predictions.create({
                    model: modelId,
                    input: {
                      prompt: enhancedPrompt,
                      // Additional generation parameters
                    },
                  });

                  // Wait for prediction to complete
                  const result = await replicate.wait(prediction);

                  // Store generated image
                  const imageUrl = await storeGeneratedImage(userId, result.output);

                  res.status(200).json({ imageUrl });
                }
                ```

    *   **Gallery Endpoints**:
        *   `/api/gallery`: Fetches image details for the user’s gallery, sorted chronologically.
        *   `/api/gallery/delete`: Allows users to delete images from their gallery.

    *   **Payment Endpoints**:
        *   `/api/payment/subscribe`: Manages subscription sign-ups via Stripe.
        *   `/api/payment/webhook`: Listens for Stripe events to update payment status.

*   **Asynchronous Operations**:
    *   **Model Training**: Replicate training is asynchronous and may take minutes to hours. `/api/models/train` returns immediately with a training ID, and the frontend polls `/api/models/status` for updates.
    *   **Image Generation**: If generation is slow, `/api/generate` can return a prediction ID for later polling.

            *   Stores the generated image in Supabase Storage and records it in the database.
            *   **Code Example**:
                ```javascript
                // /api/generate.js
                import { auth } from '@clerk/nextjs';
                import Replicate from 'replicate';

                export default async function handler(req, res) {
                  const { userId } = auth();
                  const { modelId, prompt } = req.body;

                  // Optionally enhance prompt
                  const enhancedPrompt = await enhancePrompt(prompt);

                  // Initialize Replicate client
                  const replicate = new Replicate({ apiToken: process.env.REPLICATE_API_TOKEN });
                  const prediction = await replicate.predictions.create({
                    model: modelId,
                    input: {
                      prompt: enhancedPrompt,
                      // Additional generation parameters
                    },
                  });

                  // Wait for prediction to complete
                  const result = await replicate.wait(prediction);

                  // Store generated image
                  const imageUrl = await storeGeneratedImage(userId, result.output);

                  res.status(200).json({ imageUrl });
                }
                ```

    *   **Gallery Endpoints**:
        *   `/api/gallery`: Fetches image details for the user’s gallery, sorted chronologically.
        *   `/api/gallery/delete`: Allows users to delete images from their gallery.

    *   **Payment Endpoints**:
        *   `/api/payment/subscribe`: Manages subscription sign-ups via Stripe.
        *   `/api/payment/webhook`: Listens for Stripe events to update payment status.

*   **Asynchronous Operations**:
    *   **Model Training**: Replicate training is asynchronous and may take minutes to hours. `/api/models/train` returns immediately with a training ID, and the frontend polls `/api/models/status` for updates.
    *   **Image Generation**: If generation is slow, `/api/generate` can return a prediction ID for later polling.
